# LungAI: Chest X-Ray Classification with Deep Learning 

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images into categories such as Normal, Pneumonia, and other lung abnormalities. It leverages deep learning techniques and optionally supports Grad-CAM visualization and interactive prediction via Streamlit.

## Features
- Multi-class classification: Normal, Pneumonia, etc.
- Built using custom CNN and/or transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet)
- Model explainability with Grad-CAM
- Optional Streamlit app for real-time prediction from uploaded X-rays
