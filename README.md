# LungAI: Chest X-Ray Classification with Deep Learning 

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images into categories such as Normal, Pneumonia, and other lung abnormalities. It leverages deep learning techniques and optionally supports Grad-CAM visualization and interactive prediction via Streamlit.

##  Features

-  Chest X-ray image classification (Normal, Pneumonia)
-  CNN-based architecture (custom or transfer learning)
-  Training & evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
-  Grad-CAM visualization for model explainability (optional)
-  Optional Streamlit app for real-time X-ray predictions

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ Use Cases
